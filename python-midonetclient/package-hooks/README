The files in this directory are not intended to be executed directly, but
included by FPM tool into generated packages, to be triggered by the
user packaging system.

The syntax should be 'sh', not 'bash', and as usual with this kind of scripts
they must be idempotent (not doing any if harm if executed more than once).
